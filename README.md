# Pokémon Red and Blue [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a randomizer based on pret's pokered disassembly, which can be found here: [**Pokémon Red**](https://github.com/pret/pokered).\
If you want to use this randomizer, follow the original project's instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), and also install python. Then run [Randomiser.py](python-rando/Randomiser.py), and then make.\
It should always be possible to complete the game, but there may be spots where you can softlock yourself.
